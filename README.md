### Hi, Welcome to my profile. ðŸ‘‹

My name is David and I am a Student of Sport Science approaching the enf of my Master's.
I'm passionate about Data Science (in football) and strive to work in professional football after having gained valuable experience in science over the past few years. :soccer: <br>

Some of my work is available here on my GitHub. Anyone who is interested can check out my code. <br>
Currently available:

+ **SOCCER22** - Code for second stage of the research project on the Succcess-Score (https://doi.org/10.2478/ijcss-2023-0013); The code is representative of and based on my work for my first publication on the Success-Score as well | https://doi.org/10.2478/ijcss-2022-0009
